This is a work in progress. Using the <a href="http://sideeffects.embl.de/about/" target="_blank">SIDER</a> database of drugs and their side effects, this visualization presents 'loops' in the data &mdash; conditions that could (directly or indirectly) manifest as a consequence of treating them. Soon to be updated with more information on the methedology and the dataset itself. May contain incomplete or inaccurate data and errors in the analysis.
